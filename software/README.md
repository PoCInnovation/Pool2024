# üëã Welcome to the PoC Software Pool 2024!

During one week, you will be able to discover the different facets of software development: from database management to devops, through a tour of existing technologies.

At the end of this pool, you will have the keys to start any software project.

The pool is divided in 2 parts: a training and an application of knowledge.

The training takes place in 5 days, each day will focus on a software theme and will be supervised by students with extensive knowledge in these areas.

External speakers will also come to bring their experience in the field and explain the main axes of software development in a company. They will also give you important tips.

## üìñ Day 1 - Language Initiation

You will choose a language: Typescript or Go and learn the basics of it by creating an interactive application in your terminal.

This choice will organize your week. You will learn something new in the chosen language each of the following days.

- [Typescript](./day01/Typescript/)
- [Go](./day01/Go/)


## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Day 2 - Database

You will discover the relational databases through the management of a PostgreSQL database in two ways: by hand with SQL queries and with an Object Relational Database (ORM). <br>

During 4 days, you've worked on the `backend` part of an application. This day you will learn how to build the `frontend` part: the User Interface. You're free to choose React for web applications, or Flutter for mobile applications.

If you've already used React and Flutter, you can even choose Angular to dive further in web UIs!
