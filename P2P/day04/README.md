# PoC P2P Pool 2023 - Day 04 - Decentralized App

**Day purposes**

✔ Create a hardhat project to setup your ethereum development environment

✔ Create an ERC 721 smart contract

✔ Build your application to interact with your contract


## Introduction

**What is Hardhat ?**

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) is a tool that will help you build your decentralized apps on an ethereum environment. Hardhat helps you compile, deploy your smart contracts and many other useful things. It is also helpful in the development phase to use local networks.

## Step 0 - Setup

Please refer to [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) file.



## Step 1 - Connecting your wallet to your web application

### 📑 **Description**:

The goal of this task is to connnect your wallet to your web application and be able to get its balance and display it to the user.

### 📌 **Tasks**:

- Create a button that will ask you to connect your metamask wallet to the website
- Display your account's balance
- Display your account's address

### 📚 **Documentation**:

Check out the [documentation](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/getting-started/#getting-started--connecting) of ethersjs to connect your wallet.

### ✔️ **Validation**:

You can now ask to the user to connect their wallet and display information about it on the page !



## Step 2 - Smart Contract

### 📑 **Description**:

During this step, you will create your smart contract that will let you mint NFTs.

### 📌 **Tasks**:

- Create an ERC721 token from the template
  - Make it mintable with an auto-incrementing id
  - Make it hold an URI

### 📚 **Documentation**:

Refer to this [page](https://www.openzeppelin.com/contracts) to create your smart contract.

### ✔️ **Validation**:

Your smart contract is created and deployed on the goerli testnet !



## Step 3 - Calling your smart contract's functions from your application

### 📑 **Description**:

Your goal now is to call your smart contract's function from your web application in order to interact with it.
The first one we are going to call is the `mint` function, which will let us create our NFT on the blockchain.

### 📌 **Tasks**:

- Create a button which will call the `mint` method of your smart contract and send the expected amount of ether, that is the mint price of your NFT.

### 📚 **Documentation**:

Quick tip: You can pass an additional object when calling your smart contract's function and a `value` property. 😉

### ✔️ **Validation**:

You minted your first NFT and can now see it in your collection in your [opensea testnet](https://testnets.opensea.io/account) account. <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->



## Step 4 - Let's see our NFTs

### 📑 **Description**:

Minting NFTs is fun, but we want to see them now right ? Let's do it !

### 📌 **Tasks**:

- Create a new `/collection` page
- Create a `getAllNFTs()` function in your smart contract to retrieve all NFTs
- Call this function in your application and display them on the page

### 📚 **Documentation**:

To display react components from a list, check out the [map() function](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#embedding-map-in-jsx) to iterate through an array and display elements out of it.

### ✔️ **Validation**:

You can now see all your NFTs on a new `/collection` page.



## Step 5 - Transferring NFTs

### 📑 **Description**:

Let's send an NFT to your friends !

### 📌 **Tasks**:

- When clicking on an NFT, show an input to the user to type in the address of the wallet you want to transfer the NFT to, and by pressing on a button, be able to transfer it.

### 📚 **Documentation**:

Check out the [ERC721 OpenZeppelin doc](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721) and find the 

### ✔️ **Validation**:

You can now send an NFT to another address ! Well done !!




## Bonus - Styling

Your application might not look really good. Use some stylesheets to make it beautiful !

There are a lot of ways to add style with react. Feel free to try one of the following :
[Standard CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
[Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)


## Conclusion

Well done ! You've accomplished a lot today, and there is so much more to discover.
Refer to the official documentations to deep-dive into these technologies :
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
  - [Ethersjs](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/)
  - [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/)

Hope you enjoyed this day !
