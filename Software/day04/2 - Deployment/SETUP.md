# Setup - [Instance]

The first thing you would normally do is to [create an instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ulVecpL6QE) with all the settings you want, like the OS, computing power, storage space...<br>
We've already done this for you today, so you only have to connect to it 🔥

### 📌 **Tasks**

Go see a supervisor to have:
  - An IP address
  - A private SSH key

Connect to the instance through SSH using the above information

### 📚 **Documentation**

- [Scaleway Instances Quickstart](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/instances/quickstart/)
- [What is SSH and how to use it](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/what-ssh-and-how-do-i-use-it)

### ✔️ **Validation**

Once you are connected to the instance, you can check the machine information with the following command:
```sh
hostnamectl
# Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS       
# Kernel: Linux 5.15.0-53-generic
# Architecture: x86-64
# Hardware Vendor: Scaleway
# Hardware Model: SCW-DEV1-S
```

You can then `exit` to go back to your terminal 😄
