    "Numpy is a library that allows us to make some matrix calculation and some graph. It's a very powerful library that is used in a lot of other library like Tensorflow, Pytorch, Scikit-learn, etc... For today, we will see how to use it in order to make some matrix calculation and some graph. It's one of the lib that is the most used in the world of data science and machine learning. Knowing how to use that lib is the first step to become a data scientist or a machine learning engineer :). So let's start by a bit of theory and then we will see how to use it.\n",

    "Matrix are table of elements, like numbers or characters. It's a very useful tool in mathematics and in computer science. It's used in a lot of domain like machine learning, data science, etc... It's a very powerful tool that allows us to make some calculation that we can't do with a simple number. It allowed us to make calculations in different dimension and can create link between them. So let's see how look a matrix like :\n",
