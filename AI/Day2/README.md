**Hooray : You've made it to AI !**
On today's menu, we'll enter the wonderful world of machine learning with two major algorithms : Linear and Logistic Regression, followed by the modern approach of Deep Learning using PyTorch !

> Here's a list of resources that we believe can be useful to follow along (and that we've ourselves used to learn these topics before being able to write the subjects):

## Module 1
- [3b1b's neural network series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
