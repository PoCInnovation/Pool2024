Today, the focus is Reinforcement Learning : where machines can learn to adapt to environments and take actions based on their observations !

> Here's a list of resources that we believe can be useful to follow along (and that we've ourselves used to learn these topics before being able to write the subjects):

- [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf)
